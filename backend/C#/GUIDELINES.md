# C# Backend Guidelines

## Security

- Authentication and Authorization: Ensure that only authenticated users can access your API and that they have the appropriate permissions for the actions they are attempting to perform.
- Input Validation: Always validate and sanitize input to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Use HTTPS: Encrypt data in transit by using HTTPS to protect sensitive information from being intercepted.
Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
- Error Handling: Avoid exposing detailed error messages to users, as they can reveal sensitive information about your system. Log errors internally instead.
- Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest to protect it from unauthorized access.
- Secure Configuration: Ensure that your API configuration settings are secure and not exposed. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like API keys or connection strings.
- Use Strong Authentication Tokens: Use secure methods for generating and validating authentication tokens, such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and ensure they are properly signed and encrypted.
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): Configure CORS policies to control which domains can access your API, preventing unauthorized cross-origin requests.
- Logging and Monitoring: Implement logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents promptly.
- Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
- Dependency Management: Keep your dependencies up to date and monitor for known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

## Configuration

- Environment Variables: Store secrets in environment variables. This keeps them out of your source code and allows for easy configuration changes.
- Azure Key Vault: If you’re using Azure, store your secrets in Azure Key Vault. It provides secure storage and access management for secrets, keys, and certificates.
- User Secrets (for Development): For local development, use the Secret Manager tool in .NET to store secrets outside of your codebase. This is especially useful for ASP.NET Core applications.
- Configuration Files: If you must store secrets in configuration files, ensure they are encrypted and not included in version control. Use tools like dotnet user-secrets for local development.
- AWS Secrets Manager: If you’re using AWS, store your secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. It helps you protect access to your applications, services, and IT resources without the upfront cost and complexity of managing your own hardware security module (HSM) infrastructure.
- HashiCorp Vault: Use HashiCorp Vault for managing secrets and protecting sensitive data. It provides a unified interface to any secret while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.
- Secure Storage Libraries: Use libraries designed for secure storage, such as Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureKeyVault for Azure or Amazon.Extensions.Configuration.SystemsManager for AWS.
- Avoid Hardcoding Secrets: Never hardcode secrets directly in your source code. This makes them vulnerable to exposure if your code is ever compromised.

## Code

- Use Meaningful Names: Choose clear, descriptive names for variables, methods, and classes. This makes your code more readable and maintainable.
- Follow Naming Conventions: Stick to C# naming conventions, such as using PascalCase for class names and method names, and camelCase for variables and parameters.
- Keep Methods Short and Focused: Each method should perform a single task. This makes your code easier to understand, test, and maintain.
- Use Comments Wisely: Write comments to explain why certain decisions were made, not what the code is doing. The code itself should be self-explanatory.
- Consistent Formatting: Use consistent indentation and spacing. Tools like Visual Studio can help with automatic formatting.
- Error Handling: Implement proper error handling using try-catch blocks. Ensure that exceptions are logged and handled gracefully.
- Avoid Magic Numbers: Use constants or enums instead of hardcoding numbers or strings. This makes your code more readable and easier to update.
- Use LINQ for Collections: Leverage LINQ (Language Integrated Query) for querying and manipulating collections. It makes your code more concise and readable.
- Encapsulation: Keep your data members private and expose them through public properties. This protects the integrity of your data.
- Unit Testing: Write unit tests for your code to ensure it works as expected. This helps catch bugs early and makes refactoring safer.
- Use Async/Await for Asynchronous Programming: This makes your code more readable and helps avoid callback hell.
- Dispose of Unmanaged Resources: Implement the IDisposable interface and use the using statement to ensure unmanaged resources are properly disposed of.
