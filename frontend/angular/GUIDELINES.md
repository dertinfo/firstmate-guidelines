# Angular Guidelines

## Security

- Prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Angular automatically sanitizes data bindings to prevent XSS attacks. Avoid using innerHTML directly and use Angular’s DomSanitizer for any HTML content.
- Use Route Guards: Implement route guards to control access to different parts of your application based on user roles and authentication status.
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) CSP helps prevent XSS attacks by specifying which dynamic resources are allowed to load2.
- Avoid Direct DOM Manipulation: Use Angular’s templating and data binding features instead of directly manipulating the DOM with native APIs.
- Prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Ensure that your backend is protected against CSRF attacks. Use Angular’s HttpClient with CSRF tokens for secure communication.
- Keep Dependencies Updated: Regularly update Angular and its dependencies to include the latest security patches and improvements.
- Secure Authentication and Authorization: Implement robust authentication mechanisms like JWT or OAuth and ensure proper role-based access control.
- Use HTTPS: Always serve your application over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Configuration

- Angular CLI Configuration: angular.json: This file is the central configuration for your Angular project. It includes settings for build options, file replacements, and environment configurations. Customize it to define how your application should be built and served.
- Environment Configuration
Environment Files: Use the src/environments directory to manage different environment settings. Create separate files like environment.ts for development and environment.prod.ts for production. These files can store environment-specific variables such as API endpoints.
- Build Configuration
Build Options: Customize build options in the angular.json file. You can define different configurations for development and production builds, optimize the build output, and manage file replacements to ensure the right settings are used in each environment.
- Size Budgets
Size Limits: Set size budgets in the angular.json file to control the size of your application bundles. This helps in keeping your app lightweight and improving performance. For example:
JSON
- Lazy Loading - Implement lazy loading to improve the initial load time of your application. This can be done by configuring your routing module to load modules only when needed:
- Service Workers - PWA Setup: Configure service workers to enable Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities. This involves setting up the ngsw-config.json file and enabling service workers in your Angular project:
ng add @angular/pwa
- Custom Webpack Configuration - Advanced Customization: If you need more advanced build customizations, you can extend the default Angular build process with custom Webpack configurations. This requires creating an extra-webpack.config.js file and modifying the angular.json to include it.
- API Configuration - Use Environment Variables: Manage API endpoints and other configuration settings using environment variables. This ensures that your app can easily switch between different environments without changing the code:
TypeScript

## Code

- Use Angular CLI: Utilize Angular CLI for generating components, services, and other files to ensure consistency and save time1.
- Follow File Naming Conventions: Use a clear and logical naming convention: [name].[role].[extension] (e.g., app.component.ts)1.
- Maintain a Clear Folder Structure: Organize your project into modules and sub-modules to keep related files together1.
- Adopt Consistent Code Formatting: Use tools like Prettier or ESLint to maintain a consistent code style across your project2.
- Use TypeScript Strict Mode: Enable strict mode in TypeScript to catch potential errors early and improve code quality2.
- Break Down and Reuse Components: Create small, reusable components to promote code reuse and simplify maintenance2.
- Implement Smart and Dumb Components: Separate components into smart (container) and dumb (presentational) components to enhance readability and maintainability1.
- Use Dependency Injection: Leverage Angular’s dependency injection to manage service instances and improve testability2.
- Write Unit Tests: Ensure your code is well-tested using frameworks like Jasmine and Karma2.
- Document Your Code: Use comments and documentation to explain complex logic and improve code readability
